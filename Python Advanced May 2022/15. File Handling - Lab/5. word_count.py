# 5.Word Count
# Write a program that reads a list of words from the file words.txt and finds how many times each of the words is contained in another file text.txt. Matching should be case-insensitive.
# The results should be written to other text files. Sort the words by frequency in descending order.
#
# words.txt
# quick is fault
#
# input.txt
# -I was quick to judge him, but it wasn't his fault.
# -Is this some kind of joke?! Is it?
# -Quick, hide hereâ€¦It is safer.
#
# output.txt
# is - 3
# quick - 2
# fault - 1
