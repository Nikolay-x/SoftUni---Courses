# 1.Calculate Logarithm
# Write a program that prints the calculated logarithm of any given number
# Input
# On the first line, you will receive the number (an integer)
# On the second line, you will receive a number, which is the logarithm base. It can be either a number or the word "natural"
# The output should be formatted to the 2nd decimal digit
#
# Input
# 10
# natural
#
# Output
# 2.30

base = input()

if base == "natural":
    print(f'{log(number):.2f}')
else:
    print(f'{log(number, int(base)):.2f}')
